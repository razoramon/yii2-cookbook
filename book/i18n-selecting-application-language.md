Selecting application language
==============================

When developing applications or websites for global marked, supporting multiple languages is always a requirement.
Yii has built in solution for handling message translations but doesn’t provide anything about selecting a language
because implementation depends of requirements.

In this recipe we’ll describe some typical cases of language selection and provide ideas and code snippets so you’ll
be able to pick what’s required and implement it in your project.

## How to set application language

Setting application language is pretty simple. It can be done either via code like the following:

```php
Yii::$app->language = 'ru_RU';
```

or via application config such as `config/main.php`:

```php
return [
    // ...
    'language' => 'ru_RU',
];
```

Note that it should be done every request before any output in order for outputted content to be affected.
Good places to consider are custom `UrlManager`, custom `UrlRule`, controller's or module's `beforeAction()`
or application bootstrap.

## Detecting language automatically

Detecting language automatically could help your application to conquer international markets if done properly.
The following code shows selecting a language using information supplied by user’s browser and a list of languages
your application supports:

```php
$supportedLanguages = ['en', 'ru'];
$languages = Yii::$app->request->getPreferredLanguage($supportedLanguages);
```

Note that language should be set prior to controller action so it’s a good idea to create language selection component:

```php

namespace app\components;
use yii\base\BootstrapInterface;
class LanguageSelector implements BootstrapInterface
{
    public $supportedLanguages = [];

    public function bootstrap($app)
    {
        $preferredLanguage = $app->request->getPreferredLanguage($this->supportedLanguages);
        $app->language = $preferredLanguage;
    }
}
```

In order to use the component you should specify it in the application config like the following:

```php
return [
    'bootstrap' => [
        [
            'class' => app\components\LanguageSelector::className(),
            'supportedLanguages' => ['en_US', 'ru_RU'],
        ],
    ],
    // ...
];
```

As was mentioned above, it could be implemented in custom `UrlManager`, custom `UrlRule` or controller's / module's `beforeAction()` instead.

## Support selecting language manually

While it sounds like a great idea to always detect language, it’s usually not enough. Detection could fail so
user will get language he doesn’t know, user may know many languages but prefer, for example, English for information
about travelling. These problems could be solved by providing visible enough language selector that somehow remembers
what was selected and uses it for the application further.

So the solution consists of three parts:

1. Language selector.
2. Storing what was selected.
3. Reusing what was stored.

Let’s start with language selector widget. Overall it’s a simple select widget pre-filled with an array of
language code => language name pairs.

```php
<?= Html::beginForm() ?>
<?= Html::dropDownList('language', Yii::$app->language, ['en-US' => 'English', 'zh-CN' => 'Chinese']) ?>
<?= Html::submitButton('Change') ?>
<?= Html::endForm() ?>
```

Form handling should be done in controller. A good place to do it is `SiteController::actionLanguage`:

```php
$language = Yii::$app->request->post('language');
Yii::$app->language = $language;

$languageCookie = new Cookie([
    'name' => 'language',
    'value' => $language,
    'expire' => time() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 30, // 30 days
]);
Yii::$app->request->cookies->add($languageCookie);
```

We’re using cookie to store the language. But it could be, for example, database:

```php
$user = Yii::$app->user;
$user->language = $language;
$user->save();
```

Now we can improve `LanguageSelector` a bit:

```php
namespace app\components;
use yii\base\BootstrapInterface;

class LanguageSelector implements BootstrapInterface
{
    public $supportedLanguages = [];

    public function bootstrap($app)
    {
        $preferredLanguage = isset($app->request->cookies['language']) ? (string)$app->request->cookies['language'] : null;
        // or in case of database:
        // $preferredLanguage = $app->user->language;

        if (empty($preferredLanguage)) {
            $preferredLanguage = $app->request->getPreferredLanguage($this->supportedLanguages);
        }

        $app->language = $preferredLanguage;
    }
}
```

## Language in URL / subdomain

So far we’ve found a way to detect language, select it manually and store it. For intranet applications and
applications for which search engine indexing isn’t important, it is already enough. For others you need to
expose each application language to the world.

The best way to do it is to include language in the URL such as `http://example.com/ru/about` or subdomain
such as `http://ru.example.com/about`.

The most straightforward implementation is about creating URL manager rules for each URL you have. In these
rules you need to define language part i.e.:

```php
'<language>/<page>' => 'site/page',
```

The con of this approach is that it is repetitive. You have to define it for all URLs you have and
you have to put current language to parameters list each time you’re creating an URL such as:

```php
<?= Html::a('DE', ['post/view', 'language' => 'de']); ?>
```

Thanks to Yii we have an ability to replace default URL class with our own right from config file:

```php
return [
    'components' => [
        'urlManager' => [
           'ruleConfig' => [
                'class' => app\components\LanguageUrlRule::className()
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

Here’s what language aware URL rule class could look like:

```php
class LanguageUrlRule extends UrlRule
{
    public function init()
    {
        if ($this->pattern !== null) {
            $this->pattern = '<language>/' . $this->pattern;
            // for subdomain it should be:
            // $this->pattern =  'http://<language>.example.com/' . $this->pattern,
        }
        $this->defaults['language'] = Yii::$app->language;
        parent::init();
    }
}
```

### Ready to use extension

[yii2-localeurls extension](https://github.com/codemix/yii2-localeurls) implements reliable and quite customizable way of handling language in URLs.
